Selected Features:
Feature 1: age (Patient's age in years)
Feature 2: maximum_heart_rate_achieved (Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise)
1. Histogram Analysis:
Two separate histograms were generated for the selected features:
Age (age):
The histogram shows a distribution primarily between 30 and 70 years, with a slight concentration of patients around the age of 50.
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (maximum_heart_rate_achieved):
This feature shows a wide range of values, with a majority of values clustering between 120 and 180 bpm.
2. Scatter Plot Analysis:
The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between age and maximum_heart_rate_achieved.
Observations:
There is a clear negative trend in the data:
Younger patients tend to achieve higher maximum heart rates during exercise.
Older patients tend to achieve lower maximum heart rates.
This trend aligns with physiological expectations, as maximum heart rate decreases with age.
The data points are fairly well-distributed, indicating a consistent pattern.
Correlation Trend:
The scatter plot suggests a negative correlation between age and maximum_heart_rate_achieved.
3. Conclusion:
The analysis confirms that age and maximum heart rate achieved are strongly related in a negative linear trend.
This relationship highlights an important insight: older patients are likely to achieve lower maximum heart rates.
